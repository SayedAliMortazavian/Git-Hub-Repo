## Understanding Data with Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide the basic tools to summarize and describe datasets, helping to reveal patterns and insights:

- **Types of Variables**: Understanding categorical vs numerical variables.
- **Descriptive Measures**: Including mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Frequency Distributions**: For categorical and numerical data.
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, box-and-whisker plots, and other graphical summaries.
- **Data Shape**: Concepts like left and right skewness, range, interquartile range (IQR).

## Modeling Data with Probability Distributions

Learn how to model and interpret data variability using probability distributions, enabling predictions and uncertainty quantification.

---

## The Central Limit Theorem

Explore the foundational theorem that explains why sample means approximate a normal distribution, critical for inferential statistics.

---

## Making Estimates with Confidence Intervals

Understand how to quantify the precision of estimates and the range within which population parameters lie with a given confidence level.

---

## Drawing Conclusions with Hypothesis Tests

Develop the skills to perform hypothesis testing to make evidence-based decisions and validate assumptions about populations.

---

## Making Predictions with Regression Analysis

Apply regression techniques to model relationships between variables and predict future outcomes based on historical data.

---

This repository will be continually expanded with practical examples, code snippets, and case studies to demonstrate these statistical concepts in action.
