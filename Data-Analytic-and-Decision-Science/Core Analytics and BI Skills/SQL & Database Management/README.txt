# Maven Movies SQL Business Intelligence Project

## Project Overview

This project simulates a business intelligence audit for a fictional DVD rental company called **Maven Movies**. The objective is to support strategic business decisions by answering 16 key business questions using SQL. These questions cover operational, customer, and financial aspects of the company, using SQL to extract insights from a relational database.

The use case resembles a real-world scenario where a company is preparing for a potential **merger, acquisition, internal audit**, or **performance review** ‚Äî and stakeholders such as **investors, analysts, and management** demand hard evidence and KPIs derived from the company‚Äôs data infrastructure.

## Dataset Description

The database consists of multiple normalized tables representing the operations of a DVD rental business. Key tables include:

- `staff`: Employee information.
- `store`: Store location and management.
- `inventory`: Individual DVDs and their availability.
- `customer`: Basic information on customers.
- `rental`: Rentals made by customers.
- `payment`: Financial transactions from rentals.
- `film`: Films in inventory.
- `category`: Film categories (e.g., Comedy, Action).
- `actor`: Actors in each film.
- `film_actor`: Relationship table between `film` and `actor`.
- `investor` and `advisor`: Stakeholder data.

## SQL Techniques Used

The following SQL techniques were used across the queries:

- `JOIN` operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine relational data
- `GROUP BY`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()` for aggregations
- `CASE` statements for conditional output
- `UNION` to merge different data sources
- `ORDER BY` for sorting KPIs
- Filtering with `WHERE` clauses (e.g., filtering active customers)
- Use of `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates

These techniques reflect real-world SQL use in business analytics, reporting, and dashboard creation.
